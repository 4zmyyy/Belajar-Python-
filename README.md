# Learning-Python

> **This is my repository for learning Python from scratch.**

I started learning Python because I want to understand the basics of programming and improve my logical thinking skills. I donâ€™t have any prior programming background, so this is my first step into the world of coding. However, i have an interest into AI, Machine Learning, Coding & LLM.

## What I've Learned So Far

So far, Iâ€™ve learned some basic Python concepts, such as:
- **Variables and Data Types**: How to store data in variables.
- **User Input**: Creating programs that can interact with users.
- **Conditionals (`if-else`)**: Making decisions based on certain conditions.
- **Loops (`for`, `while`)**: Automating repetitive tasks.
- **Functions**: Organizing code into reusable blocks.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Understanding how models focus on specific parts of input data.
- **Heatmap Visualization** : Creating heatmaps to visualize data distributions and model attention.
- **Export GIF/MP4** : Saving visual outputs as GIF or MP4 for better presentation and analysis.
-  **Reinforcement Learning Animation** : Random visualization to look agent behaviour.
-  **Sankey Diagram** : Visualizes token interactions using flow diagram.
-  **Nested Loop** : Loop in Loop, use for make 2D structure diagram.
-  **Simple pattern 2D** : Make a simple design with star, cross pattern, multi cross, hollow pyramid diagram

## Progress on Day 1 & 2 ( Feb, 13-14, 2025 )

- **To-Do List**: An app to add, view, and delete tasks.
- **Calculator**: A program to perform basic math operations.
- **Number Guessing Game**: A simple interactive game to guess a random number.

## Progress on Day 3 ( Feb, 15, 2025)

- **Basic Python & Machine learning Theory**: Learned about libraries like NumPy and Pandas for Data Analysis & Machine Learning
- **Analysis of product sales using the Panda library**: Created a simple program to analyze product sales data, calculate revenue, and identify best-selling product.

## Progress on Day 4-7 ( Feb, 19 - 22)

- **Exploring Attention Mechanism**: Learned how attention weights work in Transformers and visualized them using heatmaps.
- **Heatmap Animation** : Created a simple animation to display attention weights using Matplotlib.
- **Export as GIF/MP4** : Saved the visualization as a GIF and MP4 file to share.
- **Animated Attention Heatmap** : Color intensity represents attention strength, Animated layer transitions, Generates GIF output
- **Sankey Diagram** : Visualizes token interactions using flow diagram with Arrow, Nodes represent tokens/attention, Customizable colors/labels
- **Reinforcement Learning Animation** : Random action selection, Real-time pole balancing visualization, Outputs GIF of agent behavior

## Progress on Day 8-9 ( Feb, 25-26)
- **Loops (`for`, `while`)**: Automating repetitive tasks (remind).
- **Functions**: Organizing code into reusable blocks (remind). 
-  **Nested Loop** : Loop in Loop, use for make 2D structure diagram.
-  **Simple pattern 2D** : Make a simple design with star, cross pattern, multi cross, hollow pyramid diagram
