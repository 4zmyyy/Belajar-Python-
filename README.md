# Learning-Python

> **This is my repository for learning Python from scratch.**

I started learning Python because I want to understand the basics of programming and improve my logical thinking skills. I donâ€™t have any prior programming background, so this is my first step into the world of coding.

## What I've Learned So Far

So far, Iâ€™ve learned some basic Python concepts, such as:
- **Variables and Data Types**: How to store data in variables.
- **User Input**: Creating programs that can interact with users.
- **Conditionals (`if-else`)**: Making decisions based on certain conditions.
- **Loops (`for`, `while`)**: Automating repetitive tasks.
- **Functions**: Organizing code into reusable blocks.

## Progress on Day 1 & 2 ( Feb, 13-14, 2025 )

On my first & second day, I started creating simple programs like:
- **To-Do List**: An app to add, view, and delete tasks.
- **Calculator**: A program to perform basic math operations.
- **Number Guessing Game**: A simple interactive game to guess a random number.

## Progress on Day 3 ( Feb, 15, 2025)
- **Basic Python & Machine learning Theory**: Learned about libraries like NumPy and Pandas for Data Analysis & Machine Learning
- **Analysis of product sales using the Panda library**: Created a simple program to analyze product sales data, calculate revenue, and identify best-selling product.

These projects are still very basic, but they help me understand how Python works in practice.
